If such a large number of our children can be taken so effortlessly and without early detection, then the crisis confronting us is far more alarming than many may yet appreciate.\n\nThe Nigerian state cannot continue to watch helplessly while its citizens are attacked with reckless abandon. Our country is drifting dangerously towards the precipice of state failure, and this reality should trouble every well-meaning Nigerian. Nothing captures our national distress more starkly than the current surge of violence across the country. Painfully, schools - the very beacon of hope and the pathway to the future for our children - are now being shut down nationwide because the state can no longer guarantee their safety. This is unacceptable and should alarm every one of us.\n\nI therefore call on the Nigerian state to act decisively to halt this dangerous descent into anarchy. A critical starting point is to address the hunger and extreme hardship ravaging the land. In any society where poverty has reached catastrophic levels, insecurity becomes an inevitable consequence. He who sows the wind should not be surprised to reap the whirlwind.\n\nThe government must also demonstrate a sincerity of purpose in its approach to insecurity. The present administration must go beyond routine condemnations of criminality and commence a real, structured, coordinated, and enduring process of policing the nation.\n\nSenator Nenadi Usman, PhD\nInterim National Chairman, Labour Party\n22nd November, 2025",

  "text": "On the Abduction of Pupils and Teachers from St. Mary’s Catholic School, Papiri, Niger State\n\nWithin hours of the world marking World Children’s Day on 20 November, a day that reaffirms every child’s right to safety and education, terrorists stormed St. Mary’s Catholic Primary and Secondary Schools in Papiri, Niger State, abducting pupils, teachers, and shooting a security officer. I pray for the speedy recovery of the security officer, the safe return of every child and teacher that has been abducted, and the healing of the families whose sense of safety has been shattered. \n\nThis incident, which is coming in the same week as the kidnapping of innocent young girls from Maga in Kebbi State, shows a systemic pattern of violence that is targeting schools, places of worship, farms, and highways. At the same time, key security figures, including the Minister of Defence, the National Security Adviser, the Inspector General of Police and the Chief of Defence Staff, travelled out of the country for one engagement or the other.  International cooperation is important, but when children are being abducted from schools, it is not enough to issue statements after the fact. Nigerians want to see visible, coordinated, decisive, and proactive action. \n\nAccording to UNICEF, Nigeria already has more than 18 million out of school children, the highest number in the world. Each attack on a school does not only increase that number, it deepens the fear that learning is unsafe and the future is uncertain. When children are taken from classrooms, schooling becomes a risk, not a right, and parents begin to withdraw their children long after the guns go silent. These incidents damage not only today’s education, but tomorrow’s workforce, tomorrow’s economy, and tomorrow’s peace. A nation cannot plan for the future if its children are too afraid to prepare for it.\n\nNigeria does not lack security frameworks, what is missing is sustained commitment. The Safe Schools Declaration, which the Federal Government endorsed in 2018 with the disbursement of an initial sixteen billion naira in 2022 for the Safe Schools Programme, was intended to help secure learning environments. Under the current administration, this initiative has been left largely unfunded and dormant. We cannot claim to be serious about protecting schools while abandoning a critical national structure designed to do exactly that. \n\nThis is a moment for full national coordination, not scattered responses. The National Council of State exists for times like this. It is not a ceremonial gathering, it is a constitutional mechanism for drawing on the experience of former presidents and other senior figures to strengthen public order and give clear direction. If we will not use such an instrument now, when will we?\n\nIn 2022, the President, then a presidential aspirant, informed Nigerians that it was his turn to lead. If it is anyone’s turn, then it is also the turn of Nigerian children to be protected as a matter of urgency, while they acquire knowledge to help them direct our future. The right to lead cannot be separated from the duty to protect. Mandates are not upheld by chants or slogans; they are upheld by the safety and trust of the citizens — starting with the youngest and most vulnerable amongst us.\n\nI have said before that Nigeria cannot defeat terror with guns alone. If people cannot make legitimate income, they will create illegitimate ones. Security is not only about operations, it is about opportunity, dignity and trust in the state. Nigeria still has the institutions, the intelligence and the human capacity to protect itself. The real question is whether leadership is ready to use them with the urgency, discipline and courage this moment demands.\n\nChibuike Rotimi Amaechi",

  "text": "BREAKING: 315 students, teachers confirmed abducted from Niger Catholic school, says CAN \n\nThe Niger state chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) says 315 people — including 303 students and 12 teachers — were abducted from St. Mary’s Catholic Primary and Secondary School in Papiri, Agwarra LGA.\n\nGunmen carried out the abduction after attacking the school in the wee hours of November 21.\n\nCAN had initially given the number of abductees as 227 — comprising “215 pupils and students, including 12 teachers”.\n\nHowever, in a fresh statement, Bulus Yohanna, CAN chairman and Catholic Bishop of Kontagora Diocese, said a verification exercise and final census showed the figures of missing persons are much higher.\n\nThe only question I have is:\nHOW did terrorists transport 315 human beings from one place to another unknown location in the bush without anybody in the community knowing about it, without anybody in the security forces knowing about it and all this happening in an area that was already under “government protection and surveillance”???\n\nHOW did the terrorists manage this feat? Did they use trucks? Lorries? Buses? Donkeys? Or what exactly did they use to move 315 people and nobody noticed them?\n\nAnyway, when we are ready to tell each other the truth, we will admit that there is massive collaboration, compromise and collusion at the highest level of government playing a direct role in assisting the terrorists in these atrocities.",
